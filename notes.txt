these are the remaining items for me to do on this:
* cleanup the TODO statements in the code
* finish the refactoring of jobtype/jobdata
** this means the UI for jobs to have a smarter interface that will toggle between the fields
** this means we can post jobs of each type via the api and put them in the scheduler

* make the power benchmark program launch
* figure out a way to monitor the progress of a power job
* figure out a way to ensure we only run one power job at a time
* figure out a way to report the results of the power job (right now it is all reported from the client?)
** can this be pulled to wpt-controller and emailed out as a summary

* verify dependencies
* verify push from the api works
* figure out the proper benchmarks we can run, i.e. bla (doesn't work), power gadget (not really working), and other methods

* what is working
** installation of builds (entered through the webUI running in --jobtype=power mode)
*** this is done via editing config.json and sending that to benchmark.py program
** jobs in queue, dequeued once *ran* (although running doesn't do anything)
** manually kicking off jobs via python benchmark --is-dispatcher launches on client
